\section{Client.cs}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{New Set-Only-Attribute:} TimeoutTime - sets default timeout time for this client as well as this client connection's timeout time
	\item Connect message is now stored in a private field, instead of being created for each connection attempt
	\item \textbf{Signature Change} Connect() has now an additional optional bool parameter defaulting to true. If false, the reflections based message handling system is completely disabled
	\item StartTime() is called before Heartbeat in connect
	\item In case reflections does not find a connection handler marked method with correct signature, but with server signature, an more expressive exception is thrown instead of just not working
	\item \textbf{AckExtra} message type removed
	\item Reject message handler does not set the connection to pending anymore, in case a reject message with status pending is set
	\item Send() now returns an ushort return code
	\item new internal disconnect: Now with connection and disconnect reason as arguments, calling local disconnect if connection from args is connected with given disconnect reason
\end{itemize}
